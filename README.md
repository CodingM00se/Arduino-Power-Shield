# Arduino-Power-Shield
12V to 5V Buck Converter Shield. Made using Altium. Strictly for demo and learning purposes.

Ordered 5 pcs off of JLCPCB as of 3/9/2023 for around $45. Will upload pictures upon arrival!

Electronics shortage will increase costs and lead times on this, so I would consider against purchasing this board directly. Instead, study it as a learning tool, and build your own! 

A step by step tutorial on how to make a similar board can be found on Altium's Education site if you're looking for similar learning or training.
