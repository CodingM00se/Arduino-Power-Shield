# Arduino-Power-Shield
12V to 5V Buck Converter Shield. Made using Altium. Strictly for demo and learning purposes.

Ordered 5 pcs off of JLCPCB as of 3/9/2023 for around $45 with some component assembly. Will upload pictures upon arrival!

Electronics shortage will increase costs and lead times on this, so I would consider against purchasing this board directly with components assembled. Instead, study it as a learning tool, and build your own! Otherwise, I would purchase the board (and the board only) without any assembly to save costs and time. 

A step by step tutorial on how to make a similar board can be found on Altium's Education site if you're looking for similar learning or training.

(not sponsored by them, just learned this way. Happy hunting!)

Happy to reach out and answer questions always, or just talk tech:
