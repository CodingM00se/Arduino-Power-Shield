# Arduino-Power-Shield
5V - 12V Buck Converter Shield. Made using Altium. Strictly for demo purposes.

Ordered 5 pcs off of JLCPCB as of 3/9/2023 for around $45
Electronics shortage will increase costs and lead times on this, so I would consider against purchasing this board directly. 

A step by step tutorial on how to make a similar board can be found on Altium's Education site if you're looking for similar learning or training.
